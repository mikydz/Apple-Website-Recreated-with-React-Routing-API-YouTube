# Apple-Website-Recreated-with-React-Routing-API-YouTube
 To rebuild Apple's current website, I created components for various pages using React. The app implements routing by passing each path/page and rendering the components for each page based on the page's URL. If the user navigates to a wrong path or a path that is not defined by the route, a separate component is included to display a 404 page. I imported switch component that react router provides to render the defined paths, but to show the 404 page when the path that the user entered does not match the defined page. The recreated website is also modified to display Appleâ€™s channel by making YouTube API request.
